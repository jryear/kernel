# Kernel 3.2.0 tranche 1 checkpoint

Owner: sol-1. Authority: Zack, 2026-11-03. Plan instruction_version: 2.
Independent reviewer: the separate Opus session; this document does not attest its
review. Only self-check, cleanup and sandbox-spike were undertaken. Sandbox,
flake, mutants, red-team, default-on and release were not started.

All three branches start at main `d5534ae3b23a2affe01dc99ded5c8783f094c6eb`.
They are independent, not stacked or integrated. No merge or push to main.
The installed 3.1.0 was the external judge for both implementation contracts.

## self-check

- Branch: `kernel/self-check`
- Head SHA: `2da4b773cfb0bf4606d45082e954964671aa0767`
- FROZEN_BASE: `b17e544c823817d886dbafc90c38577049135bdc`
- Contract: `tasks/self-check.toml`; evidence: `tests/self_check.py` plus the
  unchanged `selftest.py` fixture helper, both declared in the frozen chain.
- Baseline log: `/private/tmp/kernel-tranche1-self-check-baseline-v2.jsonl`
- Claim log: `/private/tmp/kernel-tranche1-self-check-claim.jsonl`

Baseline output (exit 0):

```text
BASELINE_READY  self-check  assurance=schema2-evidence-validity
  [accep] base:fail  release integrity refusal
```

The exact baseline failed IDs are ALTERED_MANIFEST, ALTERED_REPORT,
ALTERED_RUNTIME, ALTERED_VERIFIER and MISSING_DIGEST, with harness_error=false.
All five pass on the candidate: exit 3, a release-integrity diagnostic, and no
verdict or baseline-ready output. The intact copied package first establishes a
working fixture. Expected manifest digest is supplied via caller argument
`--release-sha256` or `VERIFY_RELEASE_SHA256`; there is no local-manifest trust
fallback. The digest authenticates the manifest, whose entries authenticate the
release file bytes before runtime/report imports.

Claim output (exit 0):

```text
SUPPORTED  self-check  assurance=schema2-evidence-validity
  [accep] base:fail  release integrity refusal
  [accep] candidate:pass  release integrity refusal
```

Desk prove: exit 0, `PASS python3 tests/self_check.py (467ms)`, `GREEN at 2da4b77`,
dirty=false. Proof file in common Git metadata:
`desk/proof/self-check/2026-11-03T224428563Z-2da4b773cfb0.toml`.
Branch pushed to origin. All six existing self-tests also passed, using a locally
computed development digest of the reviewed package. That is regression evidence,
not authentication of an untrusted candidate and not evidence for the new item.

The first freeze attempt `6598ef17bab5df0ca6c3b8d9f96faf3b1ec49b10` produced
BASELINE_NOT_READY due to a temporary-fixture cwd setup error. Its log is retained
at `/private/tmp/kernel-tranche1-self-check-baseline.jsonl`. No implementation
preceded the corrected contract-only refreeze. That failed attempt is not RED.

Limits: a replaced verifier can remove its own guard. The caller must externally
authenticate the entrypoint and hold the expected release digest outside candidate
control. This is startup integrity, not malicious-code sandboxing or a release.

## cleanup

- Branch: `kernel/cleanup`
- Head SHA: `9de19fcae4e84702dfeec07a3a0299042de8c333`
- FROZEN_BASE: `06df2ef314d67da5d5878d749b75f1c4d77e8af8`
- Contract: `tasks/cleanup.toml`; evidence: `tests/cleanup.py`.
- Baseline log: `/private/tmp/kernel-tranche1-cleanup-baseline.jsonl`
- Claim log: `/private/tmp/kernel-tranche1-cleanup-claim.jsonl`

Baseline output (exit 0):

```text
BASELINE_READY  cleanup  assurance=schema2-evidence-validity
  [accep] base:fail  process cleanup evidence
```

The exact failed IDs are ESCAPE_UNVERIFIABLE, GROUP_KILLED,
KILL_FAILURE_UNVERIFIABLE and TIMEOUT_UNVERIFIABLE, with harness_error=false.
MISSING_UNVERIFIABLE already passes on 3.1.0 and is deliberately not declared RED.
The evidence runs actual nested schema2 CLI verifications against committed
fixture repositories, checks child liveness/receipt identities and final verdicts,
and confines kill-failure injection to the nested candidate's OS killpg boundary.

Claim output (exit 0):

```text
SUPPORTED  cleanup  assurance=schema2-evidence-validity
  [accep] base:fail  process cleanup evidence
  [accep] candidate:pass  process cleanup evidence
```

All five IDs pass on candidate. In-group child is dead before supported; an
escaped setsid child is named by PID, group and start identity in cleanup.survivors
and makes the nested verdict unverifiable. Timeout, kill failure and missing
receipt also produce unverifiable, never finite assertion RED or supported.
Checks use separate POSIX sessions/groups in both schemas; receipts include
observations, errors, timeout and cleanup completeness. Incomplete evidence takes
precedence over certification/contradiction. Escaped processes get best-effort
remediation but their observed escape still invalidates evidence.

Desk prove: exit 0, `PASS python3 tests/cleanup.py (8758ms)`, `GREEN at 9de19fc`,
dirty=false. Common Git proof:
`desk/proof/cleanup/2026-11-03T224804626Z-9de19fcae4e8.toml`.
Branch pushed to origin. All six existing self-tests passed on this change too.

Limits: ps sampling plus an inherited random marker observes descendants; a
hostile process can erase attribution and escape between observations. This does
not prove exhaustive containment. Legacy services, as distinct from individual
checks, retain their lifecycle limitation. Tests are macOS/POSIX evidence, not
Linux acceptance. Protected-path hashing/sandbox implementation is out of scope.

## sandbox-spike

- Branch: `kernel/sandbox-spike`
- Implementation head SHA: `91e3495d2f8051aae2abfc4419e1825d318aca45`.
- The checkpoint is a documentation-only descendant of that implementation.
  Resolve the delivered branch/checkpoint HEAD with `git rev-parse HEAD`; a file
  cannot embed the SHA of the commit containing itself. The final clean-HEAD desk
  proof is kept in common Git metadata and the delivery message names that SHA.
- FROZEN_BASE: not applicable; research item, not a kernel implementation claim.
- Judge baseline output, judge claim verdict and judge log: not applicable.
  No installed-judge SUPPORTED verdict is asserted for this research.
- Acceptance: `python3 spike/sandbox_probe.py`. Exit 0 means every requested
  payload completed and observations were recorded, regardless of whether its
  operations succeeded or were denied. Setup/incomplete payloads cannot return
  completed success; the script does not decide a security pass.
- Dependency installed locally under spike: exact
  `@anthropic-ai/sandbox-runtime@0.0.81`, locked transitive dependencies, no global
  installation. `node_modules` and generated rerun results are ignored.
- Runtime: macOS, Node v24.22.0, Python 3.15.0.

Desk prove at implementation head: exit 0,
`PASS python3 spike/sandbox_probe.py (27597ms)`, `GREEN at 91e3495`,
dirty=false at invocation. The checkpoint/finding wording is documentation added
after that source proof; final checkpoint HEAD is re-proved while clean before
push. The exact final SHA and proof are available from desk status and delivery.
An earlier clean implementation proof also returned GREEN at d4079a0 (27565ms).

Evidence: `spike/evidence/observations.json`, `spike/evidence/cli-collector.log`;
architecture and exact boundaries: `spike/FINDINGS.md`. Current local rerun
results: `spike/results/results.json`, `library.json`, and CLI collector files.
Recorded package/probe hashes match the corresponding source bytes; observations
are not inferred from a process exit alone.

Both CLI and embedded paths separately exercised prestarted collection, a denied
canary, 150 denied writes, delayed denials after leader exit, temporary-directory
writes, SSH/.env open denial and loopback-only application traffic. Protected
fixture hashes stayed unchanged. The committed library sample has 150 EPERM
writes but only 148 matching emitted denial events. Its subscription received
221 total events while the store retained just 100. The synthetic store-only
150-event exercise independently demonstrates the 100-event tail and preattached
subscription. CLI's first canary returned EPERM without a matching log event.
Neither collector supplies an acknowledged ready protocol.

Recommendation: embedded trusted supervisor, opt-in log monitor, subscription
before execution, unique invocation IDs, and a bounded post-exit drain. CLI is a
usable confinement wrapper but initializes without its own log monitor. Neither
path provides a complete authoritative log ledger. Hash protected paths before
and after each check for tamper evidence; logs explain attempted operations and
never establish intent. Do not install product srt inside a candidate write root.
This recommendation was not built.

Not proved: external egress refusal (only loopback was exercised, honoring the
no-network constraint), complete log delivery or attribution, a guaranteed final
event boundary, hostile descendant containment, Linux behavior or production
readiness. Non-allowlisted loopback proxy request got HTTP 403 without risking an
external connection. Missing evidence has not been promoted to a verdict.

## Desk loop findings and boundary incident

Claims, heartbeats and prove ran from this worktree with `--root .`, agent sol-1,
plan v2. No heartbeat returned 3. No planner files were edited. The loop worked;
these are friction/findings, not changes to desk:

1. Claim records the intended branch but neither creates nor switches it. I
   explicitly switched from main for each independent item. All lease worktree
   paths refer to this same checkout; rerunning an earlier item's proof requires
   first switching to its branch (or an explicit correct worktree).
2. Prove records SHA, cleanliness **before** acceptance, result code, tail and
   output hash. It does not freeze a schema2 contract, verify assertion receipts,
   bind an instruction version in the proof or check post-command cleanliness.
   I separately inspected cleanliness and retained the external judge JSONL.
3. State is under shared Git metadata
   `/Users/jryear/code/_kernel/.git/desk/`, written by the required desk commands,
   not under the planner-owned `.desk/`. Required Git branch/snapshot operations
   likewise use the repository's common metadata; no installed source checkout
   or installation was performed.
4. After these items, desk may suggest flake as its next open item. That does not
   extend this tranche's scope; work stops at this checkpoint.
5. **Read-only boundary incident:** the initial Python 3.15 judge invocations
   generated `~/code/_kernel/__pycache__/kernel_runtime.cpython-315.pyc` (31983
   bytes) and `kernel_report.cpython-315.pyc` (6540 bytes), both timestamped
   2026-11-03 14:43:27 Pacific. This violates the instruction to write nothing
   there. They were not deleted or modified again. Further judge invocations
   must set `PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE=1` or use `python3 -B`. Installed source and
   main checkout remain unchanged; this is not a claim of zero filesystem writes.

Read-only final source hashes of the installed judge:

```

## Review boundary

The independent branches intentionally overlap MANIFEST.sha256, README/FRONTIER
and some verifier changes. They have **not** been combined or validated together.
The reviewer/Zack owns integration and landing. This checkpoint provides narrow
contract support and research evidence, not independent-review approval or
production release acceptance. No future-tranche work or release was started.
